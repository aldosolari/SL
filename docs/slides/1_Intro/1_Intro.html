# The course

* __Big Data__ and __Data Science__ have now become recurring terms in media communication. In response to the growing need to analyze data, the profession of the __data scientist__ has recently emerged

* This course aims to provide __new tools__ for the data scientist

* These tools require __technical skills__ such as 
    - modern statistical methods
    - advanced programming
    
* They also require __professional skills__ such as 
    - communication
    - teamwork
    - problem solving
    - critical thinking

---

# Topics

The topics covered by this course are

* __Advanced statistical/machine learning models__
    - Generalized Additive Models
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Boosting algorithms
    - Ensemble learning
    
* __Large-scale testing__ &amp; __selective inference__

* __High-dimensional inference__
    - sample-splitting inference
    - stability selection
    - knockoffs


---

# Exam

* The exam consists of two parts:

    - __Written exam__ (open-ended and/or closed-ended questions)

    - __Oral exam__, including the __presentation__ of a data science __project__ (homework)
        - Attending students can form a __team__ (max. 3 persons) and present at the end of the course. In this case the oral exam is optional

* The final grade is a weighted average of written exam (1/2) and oral exam (1/2)

* See the [course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/syllabus/syllabus.html) for further informations

# Project


* Your final project is to do a __novel data analysis__ to answer a __question__ and write a __blog post__ about it on github

* The blog post should answer:
    1. __What is the question(s) you tried to answer? Why should someone care?__
    
    2. What is the data/how did you get it?
    
    3. How did you answer the questions (e.g. what statistical techniques, etc)?
    
    4. __What are your findings?__

# An example

* __Project__: [fitteR happieR](https://www.rcharlie.com/img/posts/fitter-happier/album_chart.html) by [RCharlie](https://www.rcharlie.com/)

* __Question__: which is the most depressing Radiohead song?

* __Data__ : 
    - Spotify API and the R package *spotifyr* to get the *valence* metric (the song's positivity)
    - Genius Lyrics API and the R package *rvest* to get the *lyrics* (text data)

* __Statistics__ : 
    - Sentiment analysis on lyrics to get the % of sad words in a lyric 
    - `$$GloomIndex = \frac{(1-valence)+pctSad*(1+lyricalDensity)}{2}$$`

* __Visualization__ : https://www.rcharlie.com/img/posts/fitter-happier/album_chart.html

* __Answer__: True Love Waits

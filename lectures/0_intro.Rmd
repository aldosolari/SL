## Welcome to Statistical Learning

Statistical learning comes in two variants:

* Statistical Learning M [F8204B033M]. This is a self-contained course of 6 CFU

* Statistical Learning [F8204B015]. This is part of the course Data Science (12 CFU), which is composed by Data Mining (6 CFU) and Statistical Learning (6 CFU)


## Course objectives

Acquisition of modern statistical methods for inference on complex data set, and improvement of 

* problem solving

* programming skills in R

In particular:

* Formulate quantitative models to address scientific questions

* Apply a range of statistical methods for inference

* Organize and perform a complete data analysis, from data
exploration, to analysis, to synthesis, to communication

The expected workload is $\approx 1/3$ applied and $\approx 2/3$ theorical. 

## Pre-requisites

This course is designed for 2nd year CLAMSES students. It assumes knowledge of the topics of the courses *Probabilità e Statistica Computazionale M* (modules Probabilità Applicata and Statistica Computazionale) and *Statistica Avanzata M* (modules Statistica Multivariata and Teoria dell’Inferenza Statistica).

## Course material

You can download the material from the course webpage

* the material is subject to updates: check the last version

* the material will be uploaded progressively

## Exam

The exam is divided in two parts:

1. Data analysis assignment

2. Oral exam: 1 question about 1. and 3 questions about topics discussed during the course

In particular, the data analysis assignment requires that before the oral exam, each student must submit

* A write-up of their data analysis in a synthesized format, with
numbered figures and references. (You may also include
supplementary material for detailed additional
calculations/analyses)

* A reproducible .Rmd file that produces all of the numbers,
figures and results in your write-up.

All documents should be submitted electronically. The grades will be broken down according to the following characterization of your data analysis.

1. Did you answer the scientific question?
2. Did you use appropriate statistical methods?
3. Was your write-up simple, clear, and precise?
4. Was your code reproducible?

Keep in mind that this is a data science class. In some cases
standard methodology will be sufficient to answer the question of
interest, in some cases you will need to go beyond the course. 

You may speak to your fellow students
about specific statistical questions related to the project, but the
overall idea, analysis, and write-up should be your own individual
work.

In general the goal is to *answer the question* and provide an
estimate of *uncertainty*.

## One data set, many analysts

In 2014, 29 teams of researchers were recruited and they were asked to answer the same research question with the same data set.

### Research question

> Are football (soccer) referees more likely to
give red cards to players with dark skin
than to players with light skin?

This question touches on broad issues, such as how
prejudice affects sports and how well the
effects of prejudice, as detected in laboratory
settings, show up in the real world.

### Data

All teams were given the same large
data set collected by a sports-statistics
firm across four major football leagues. 

The data can be downloaded from 

https://osf.io/47tnc/

A description of the data is

https://github.com/aldosolari/SL/tree/master/assignment/README.txt

It included referee calls, counts of how often
referees encountered each player, and player
demographics including team position,
height and weight. 

It also included a rating
of players’ skin colour. As in most such studies,
this ranking was performed manually:
two independent coders sorted photographs
of players into five categories ranging from
‘very light’ to ‘very dark’ skin tone.


### Results

Teams approached the data with a wide array of analytical techniques, and obtained highly varied results.

Of the 29 teams, 20 found a statistically
significant correlation between skin colour
and red cards.

![Figure from Silberzahn and Uhlmann (2015)](figures/results.jpg){width=500px}

The median result was that darkskinned
players were 1.3 times more likely
than light-skinned players to receive red
cards. 

But findings varied enormously, from
a slight (and non-significant) tendency for
referees to give more red cards to lightskinned
players to a strong trend of giving
more red cards to dark-skinned players.

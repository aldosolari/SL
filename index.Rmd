*Big Data* and *Data Science* have now become recurring terms in media communication. In response to the growing need to analyze data, the profession of the *data scientist* has recently emerged. This course aims to provide new tools for the data scientist. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking. See the [course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/syllabus/syllabus.html) for further information.

The topics covered by this course are

* *Advanced statistical/machine learning models*, e.g. GAMs, boosting algorithms, support vector machines
* *Large-scale testing* and *selective inference*
* *Modern inferential methods for the analysis of high-dimensional data*, e.g.  sample-splitting inference, stability selection, and knockoffs

The final project is to do a novel data analysis and write a blog post about it. See the [#Project](#project) section for more details.

# **Reading**

There are two primary references:

* [Computer-Age Statistical Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) (CASI)
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL)


**December 3** Introduction 

**December 5**



# **Exam**

Exams schedule:

|When | Where | Hour | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8/2/2019 | U7/13 | 14:00 | Written and Oral |
| 21/2/2019 | U7/13 | 14:00 | Written and Oral |

The exam consists of two parts:

- __Written exam__ (open-ended and/or closed-ended questions)

- __Oral exam__, including the __presentation__ of a data science __project__ (homework)
    - Attending students can form a __team__ (max. 3 persons) and present at the end of the course. In this case the oral exam is optional

The final grade is a weighted average of written exam (1/2) and oral exam (1/2). See the [course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/syllabus/syllabus.html) for further information.




# **Project**

Your final project is to do a novel data analysis to answer a question and write a blog post about it on github. It should answer:

1. What is the question(s) you tried to answer? Why should someone care?

2. What is the data/how did you get it?

3. How did you answer the questions (e.g. what statistical techniques, etc)?

4. What are your findings?

The following references may help with the project:

* [Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving](http://rdatasciencecases.org/) 
* [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/) 
* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* [Normal Deviate](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/)

More informations will be available soon.

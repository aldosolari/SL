*Big Data* and *Data Science* have now become recurring terms in media communication (internet, TV, radio, newspapers, etc.). In response to the growing need to analyze data, the profession of the data scientist has recently emerged and it requires transversal skills (information technology, mathematics-statistics, communication) and a scientific mindset. The course aims to provide new tools to address the analysis of complex data. The course is composed by two parts:

* Introduction to deep learning (3 CFU, Prof. Borrotti)
* [Modern inference](https://aldosolari.github.io/MI/) (3 CFU, Prof. Solari)

At the end of the course, the student will have perfected the problem solving and programming skills  and will be able to use advanced statistical methods to draw conclusions on the data.

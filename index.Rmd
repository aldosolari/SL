*Big Data* and *Data Science* have now become recurring terms in media communication. In response to the growing need to analyze data, the profession of the *data scientist* has recently emerged. This course aims to provide new tools for the data scientist. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking. See the [course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/syllabus/syllabus.html) for further information.

The topics covered by this course are

* *Statistical learning models*, e.g. GAMs, boosting algorithms
* *Large-scale testing* and *selective inference*
* *High-dimensional inference*, e.g.  sample-splitting inference, stability selection, and knockoffs

The final project is to do a novel data analysis and write a blog post about it. See the [#Project](#project) section for more details.

# **Reading**

There are two primary references:

* [Computer-Age Statistical Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) (CASI)
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL)

Calendar

**December 3** Introduction

  - CASI 1, 1.1 (pages 3-8), 4.3 (pages 45-46)

**December 5** Regression and smoothing splines

  - ESL 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.4, 5.4.1

# **Exam**

Exams schedule:

|When | Where | Hour | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8/2/2019 | U7/13 | 14:00 | Written and Oral |
| 21/2/2019 | U7/13 | 14:00 | Written and Oral |

The exam consists of two parts:

- __Written exam__ (open-ended and/or closed-ended questions)

- __Oral exam__, including the __presentation__ of a data science __project__ (homework)
    - Attending students can form a __team__ (max. 3 persons) and present at the end of the course. In this case the oral exam is optional

The final grade is a weighted average of written exam (1/2) and oral exam (1/2). See the [course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/syllabus/syllabus.html) for further information.


# **Final project**

Your final project is to do a __novel data analysis__ to answer a __question__ and write a __blog post__ about it on github. This can be interpreted broadly and the requirements are discussed below.

Examples might include:

* put together a novel data set (e.g. scrape something from the web)
* answer an interesting question
* a sophisticated statistical/machine learning model
* a really compelling visualization
* write a shiny app

The rough outline of the project is: Start with a question. Find data that might get at that question. Play around with the data. Attempt to answer the question. Iterate. Communicate. At the end you should produce:

1. Blog post

2. Analysis document


## Blog post

The blog post should answer:

* What is the question(s) you tried to answer? Why should someone care?

* What are your findings?

The blog post should be aimed at a general audience who is not afraid of graphs/a little data. 

* The post should be 1000-1500 words (unless you made a shiny app)
    - Include a title and your names
    - Donâ€™t display R code unless it is used to convey a point

* There should be at least one visualization
    - Make sure to describe the figures somewhere in the text
    - These plots should be communicatory plots, not exploratory plots
    
* The post should be submitted in html (probably written in R Markdown)

## Analysis document

The analysis document should detail the steps you took to develop the blog post. This includes where you got the data, other solutions you tried, the statistical methods you chose and your findings. The document should contain the following topics (depending on the project some of these will be more important than others): 

* Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it

* Data: What is the data/how did you get it?

* Statistical methods: How did you answer the questions (e.g. what statistical techniques, etc)? It should include text justifying decisions you made (e.g. why did you remove certain observations, etc.)

* Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site,  something we discussed in class, etc. 

* All the code used to produce the blog post from the raw data should be available on github

## Resources

The following blog posts may help with the project:

* Blog posts from [polygraph](http://polygraph.cool/)
* Blog posts from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* Blog posts from [Normal Deviate](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/)

and books:

* [Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving](http://rdatasciencecases.org/) 
* [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/) 

More informations will be available soon.
